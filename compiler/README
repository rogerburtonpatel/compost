Programs in our integration testing suite:

Currently, in our integration testing suite, we have the following test 
files (all of which work with this version of our compiler). Such files 
can be found in the tests/compile subdirectory, and the expected output 
of running each test can be found in the `.out` file with the same name.
`hello-world.com` is the simplest of those tests, and we consider that 
to be our "Hello World" program if looking at only one of these tests 
is desired.

`arith.com`: Tests primitive arithmetic operators including addition, 
             multiplication, and mod.

`emoji.com`: Tests the use of an emoji as a name and the ability to 
             print a symbol containing an emoji. 

`fib.com`: Contains the implementation of a naive fibonacci algorithm 
           and computes the 35th fibonacci number.

`gcd.com`: Contains the implementation of Euclid's Algorithm to compute 
           the GCD of two numbers.

`hello-ho.com`: Prints "Hello, World!" with the use of higher order 
                functions. This is very much a flex. 

`hello-newline.com`: Prints "Hello, World!" followed by a newline character.

`hello-world.com`: Simply prints "Hello, World!"

`if.com`: Tests the proper usage of conditional (`if`) expressions.

`in.com`: Tests the ability to read user input via stdin. This program will 
          read in one character from stdin and print out the integer representation 
          of that character (according to the ASCII table).

`print.com`: Tests all four built-in print functions (print-int, print-bool, print-sym,
             and print-unit).

`recurse.com`: Tests recursion functionality via a recursive "count-down" function.

How to run scripts:

To compile the compiler, type the following command:
    dune build 
Or, alternatively, you can type:
    make

To run all tests in our test suite, type the following command:
    ./run_tests.bash -c 

To run a specific test in our test suite, type the following command:
    ./run_tests.bash -c test_name.com 
where `test_name.com` is the name of a Compost program that can be found 
in the tests/compile/ subdirectory. For example, to run our simple 
"Hello World" test, run: `./run_tests.bash -c hello-world.com`

To run *just* the compiler on a source file (producing the executable), run:
    ./compile-compost file.com
where `file.com` is the file containing a Compost program (the full path 
needs to be specified if not in the current working directory). A runnable 
executable called `file` would then be created in the location where 
`file.com` was.

To compile *and* run a source file with one command, run:
    ./compostrun file.com
where `file.com` is the name of a file containing the Compost program to 
compile and run.

To print the LLVM IR produced by our compiler, run:
    dune exec compost file.com
where `file.com` is the name of the file containing a Compost program. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How test validates compilation or reports issues.

The tests compile the Compost program with our compiler, runs the 
executable, and diffs the output against the `.out` file found in the 
tests/compile/ subdirectory with the same name. The script reports that the test 
passed iff the output of the executable matches the output of the `.out` file,
and reports a test failure if there is a difference in the output or if the 
program could not be compiled.
