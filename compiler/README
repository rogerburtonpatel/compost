How to run scripts:

To compile the compiler, type the following command:
    dune build 
Or, alternatively, you can type:
    make

To run all tests in our test suite, type the following command:
    ./run_tests.bash 

To run a specific test in our test suite, the usage is defined as follows:
    ./run_tests.bash -{a|p|u|t|m|c|r} test_name.com 
where the inputted flag specifies which phase to test:
    -a: test scanning and parsing
    -p: test all phases specified in -a *and* preprocessing 
    -u: test all phases specified in -p *and* disambiguation of globals and locals
    -t: test all phases specified in -u *and* type checking 
    -m: test all phases specified in -t *and* explicit memory management 
    -c: test all phases of compilation and diff the LLVM output against a gold standard 
    -r: test all phases of compilation, *run the program*, and diff the program's output 
        against a gold standard.
and `test_name.com` is the name of a Compost program that can be found 
in some subdirectory within tests/ dependent on the inputted flag: 
    -a: looks in tests/ast/
    -p: looks in tests/past/
    -u: looks in tests/uast/
    -t: looks in tests/tast/
    -m: looks in tests/mast/
    -c: looks in tests/llvm/
    -r: looks in tests/run
For example, to run our simple "Hello World" test, run: 
`./run_tests.bash -r hello-world.com`

To run *just* the compiler on a source file (producing the executable), run:
    ./compile-compost file.com
where `file.com` is the file containing a Compost program (the full path 
needs to be specified if not in the current working directory). A runnable 
executable called `file` would then be created in the location where 
`file.com` was.

To compile *and* run a source file with one command, run:
    ./compostrun file.com
where `file.com` is the name of a file containing the Compost program to 
compile and run.

To print the LLVM IR produced by our compiler, run:
    dune exec compost file.com
where `file.com` is the name of the file containing a Compost program. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programs in our integration testing suite:

Currently, in our integration testing suite, we have the following test 
files (most of which work with this version of our compiler). Such files 
can be found in subdirectories of the tests/ subdirectory, and the 
expected output of running each test can be found in the `.out` file with 
the same name. Such expected output can be the expected output of the 
compiled program, the expected output of a pretty-printer at an intermediate 
compilation stage, or the expected error message to be thrown in the case of 
a negative test.

We will not be describing each individual test in the tests/ast/ subdirectory 
because there are a lot of them and they test the scanner and parser, which 
do not seem to be important for this deliverable.

TODO: Update the following descriptions 

`arith.com`: Tests primitive arithmetic operators including addition, 
             multiplication, and mod.

`emoji.com`: Tests the use of an emoji as a name and the ability to 
             print a symbol containing an emoji. 

`fib.com`: Contains the implementation of a naive fibonacci algorithm 
           and computes the 35th fibonacci number.

`gcd.com`: Contains the implementation of Euclid's Algorithm to compute 
           the GCD of two numbers.

`hello-ho.com`: Prints "Hello, World!" with the use of higher order 
                functions. This is very much a flex. 

`hello-newline.com`: Prints "Hello, World!" followed by a newline character.

`hello-world.com`: Simply prints "Hello, World!"

`if.com`: Tests the proper usage of conditional (`if`) expressions.

`in.com`: Tests the ability to read user input via stdin. This program will 
          read in one character from stdin and print out the integer representation 
          of that character (according to the ASCII table).

`print.com`: Tests all four built-in print functions (print-int, print-bool, print-sym,
             and print-unit).

`recurse.com`: Tests recursion functionality via a recursive "count-down" function.

`tail.com`: Calls a recursive function that will result in a stack overflow
            without our tailcall optimization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How test validates compilation or reports issues.

The tests compile the Compost program with our compiler, runs the 
executable, and diffs the output against the `.out` file found in the 
subdirectory containing that test with the same name. The script reports that the test 
passed iff the output of the executable matches the output of the `.out` file,
and reports a test failure if there is a difference in the output or if the 
program could not be compiled.
