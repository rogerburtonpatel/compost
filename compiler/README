How to compile / execute compiler: 

All of the scanner and parser files required for this deliverable are in 
the bin/ subdirectory. They are named as such:
 - scanner.mll
 - parser.mly
 - ast.ml
 - toplevel.ml (the driver file)

To compile, run the following command from the top directory (the directory 
containing this README).
    dune build
After compiling, execute the driver file running the scanner and parser with 
the following command:
    dune exec toplevel
Doing so would allow one to pipe in or type Compost code on standard input. When 
the driver program receives the end-of-file indicator (a user can press CTRL+D 
to send the end-of-file indicator on the command line), it will either output 
a pretty-printed abstract syntax tree (formatted similar to the inputted 
code) if the input was valid Compost syntax, or raise an error if the input 
was not valid syntax. The driver program will then exit. 


How to run test script:

To run our test script, run the following command from the top directory:
    ./run_tests.bash
This script will iterate through all tests in the tests/ subdirectory, 
input each test into our toplevel program, and compare the output against 
the expected output. For test input that is valid Compost syntax, the 
expected output will be the pretty-printed AST; for invalid Compost syntax,
the expected output is the error raised by our toplevel program. The script 
will then report details of each test and how many tests passed. 


We do not anticipate adding additional syntax to our compiler, and it should 
not be necessary to install any additional packages beyond the packages 
used in microC.
